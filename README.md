Constraint Logic Programming Labs - UoM

This repository contains the lab exercises from the Constraint Logic Programming course at the University of Macedonia. The exercises were implemented using Prolog and cover various topics related to logic programming and constraint satisfaction problems.

📌 Topics Covered

Fundamentals of Prolog programming

Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs)

Backtracking and search strategies

Arithmetic and symbolic constraints

Advanced constraint solvers

🛠️ Requirements

To run the Prolog programs, you need SWI-Prolog or any other compatible Prolog interpreter.

Installation (SWI-Prolog)

sudo apt install swi-prolog

📝 Notes

These exercises were completed as part of the university coursework and serve as a reference for learning Constraint Logic Programming. Feel free to explore and experiment with the code!
